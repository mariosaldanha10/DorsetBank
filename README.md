Software Engineering Exam


Question 1

Please answer the question based on the following scenario: You are managing a software development team that has been invited by “Dorset Bank” to develop an operating system for their ATM machines. The ATM machines should allow clients to withdraw money at any time and deposit cash or checks. Additionally, the machines should display the client's account balance. You have 4 weeks to do this project.

a)	Select a development method for this project and provide the reason for your choice, (e.g. waterfall development method, agile development method, etc.).
I have chosen agile development because this project has a tight deadline of 4 weeks and this methodology is suitable for this project because is flexible for a short and iterative cycles and this can help the project to be on track and the team to answer quickly to any issues or changes that may occur during the software development. 

b)	Provide a comprehensive list of the steps involved in the software development process.

Requirements gathering: this is the first step in software development where the team should be able to gather information for the software to be developed. This is a important steps where the team should gather the needs of users, business objectives and to define the scope of the project.

Design: this is the next step after the requirements gathering where the software design architecture and user interface design will be defined making sure that they are followed respecting the specified requirements.

Implementation: this step is actually where the code is done, the development team will make sure to follow best practices and standard coding.

Testing: this step is also very important because a unit testing will be conducted to make sure the software is free of errors and bugs. The testing team will make sure the software is running smoothly and also make sure the software is performing well as intended.

Deployment: this step is where the software will be deployed into production serves to make available for end-users to have access to the software.

Maintenance: this is an ongoing step to be followed, in this section the team will provide a feedback channel to collect users’ experiences and taking from that will make sure the system is often updated and will also provide technical support for users when they would face any issues.

c)	Write a requirement document based on the client's previous requirements, including functional requirements, interface requirements infrastructure requirements.

g)	Provide a detailed explanation of the validation and verification process that should be followed to ensure the successful completion of this project.

Validation process involves checking if the software is following the specified requirements in order to meet the software development process such as requirements review, design review, testing review to make sure all the steps have been adhering to their specifications and following their best practices. On the other hand, Verification process is where the team will make sure that the software is following the best overall phase standards and best practices and are meeting the user’s requirements, in this part some phases will be reviewed as well as code review, the team also will make sure the interface requirements are adhering their specifications.
